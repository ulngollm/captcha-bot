# Telegram Chat Bot
This project is a simple Telegram chat bot built using the telebot library and a finite state machine (FSM) to manage conversation states. The bot is designed to handle a basic interaction flow with users, transitioning through different states based on user input.

## Features:
- **State Management**: Utilizes a finite state machine to manage conversation states, allowing for a structured flow of interaction.
- **Session Handling**: Manages user sessions to maintain state across interactions.
- **Event Handling**: Responds to specific events to transition between states and handle user inputs.
